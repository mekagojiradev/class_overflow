# class_overflow
Many students in MTSU often have academic doubts and need a space to get it clarified. Our platform aims to solve that so students in universities can get their own questions answered. Inspired by Stack Overflow, we decided to build Class Overflow which is a forum style web application designed for students to share questions, respond to peers, and engage in academic discussions. The platform allows users to create accounts, log in, post questions, and respond to others’ posts. It supports upvoting and downvoting questions promoting useful content in the community. In the future, we aim to extend upvoting and downvoting to responses also, along with support for threaded (recursive) replies to have more deeper and organized discussions

# Live Demo
https://classoverflow.vercel.app/forum

# How to get it started!
1. Put the zip file in htdocs folder and extract it. (assuming you are using XAMPP)

2. Make sure your database is named "ClassOverflow." Then, run the init.sql file on the databse (phpMyAdmin). 

3. Make sure your server and database are running.

4. Use a terminal and cd to the class_overflow folder in htdocs and run ```npm install```  (if this doesn't work, make sure node is installed with ```node -v```)

5. Finally, run ```npm start``` and the website should be running! If port 3000 is already being used, type ```y``` to use another port.
